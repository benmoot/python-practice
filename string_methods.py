# String Methods

# prints length of string
parrot = "Norwegian Blue"
print len(parrot)


# prints string in all lowercase
print "Norwegian Blue".lower()

# prints string in all upper
print "Norwegian Blue".upper()


# methods with dot notation only work with strings


# prints non-strings as strings
# numbers are never strings unless made one
pi = 3.14
print str(pi)


# non-strings can be made strings with quotes
pil = "3.144"
print pil



# Test
print "The value of pi is around " + str(pi)

# leave space after printed string for non-string to appear correctly
